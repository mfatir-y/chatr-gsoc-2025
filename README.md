# ChatR-GSoC-2025

This repository contains tasks and solutions related to the Google Summer of Code 2025 project.

It demonstrates how Ollama and the `ellmer` R package can be used together to query LLMs (like `llama3.2:3b`) for information about R package through language prompts.

The generated outputs are not guaranteed to be accurate (for the hard task).

## Requirements

- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed locally
- The `llama3.2:3b` model pulled via `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
- R with the `ellmer` package installed
