# pkgfunfinder

An R package that uses the `ellmer` package to query Ollama's llama3.2 language model to extract a list of functions exported by an R package.

## Installation

You'll need to have Ollama installed and the llama3.2:3b-instruct model available.

```r
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/pkgfunfinder")
```

## Prerequisites

1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Pull the llama3.2:3b-instruct model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct
   ```

## Usage

```r
library(pkgfunfinder)

# Get functions from a package
dplyr_functions <- get_package_functions("dplyr")
print(dplyr_functions)

# You can also try with other models
tidyr_functions <- get_package_functions("tidyr", model = "llama3.2:3b-instruct", temperature = 0.1)
```

## Note

The list of functions returned by this package is generated by a language model and may not be completely accurate. This is meant as a demonstration of using LLMs to extract information about R packages.
